<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
"O'Brien to the Destktop" is a small utility-script that automatically crawls and downloads the [Chief O'Brien at Work](https://chiefobrienatwork.com/) WebComic.  
It parses the linked tumbler-pages and extracts the episode name, image URL and next episode URL.

#### Why I made this script
I was asked by a family member if there was an easy method of crawling and downloading the [Chief O'Brien at Work](https://chiefobrienatwork.com/) WebComic for offline reading.
None existed, so I made one.

> Reading the comic online felt very inefficient. Being able to wiz through it in an image-browser made it such a delight to read.  
> &emsp;- Family member
